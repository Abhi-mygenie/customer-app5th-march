## Session 2026-10-07 — Role 2 Planning (Impact Analysis) · no app code changed
- Operating prompt: `control/MYGENIE_CUSTOMER_APP_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_ALPHA_v0_1.md`
- BUG-2026-10-06-001 → `IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md` written; index.yml `INTAKE → PLANNING`. New finding: 200/rid rolling cap will be consumed by allow events (D4). Owner decisions open: D1, D4, D5, D6
- CR-2026-10-03-003 → `IMPACT_ANALYSIS.md` written; index.yml `INTAKE → PLANNING`. CRM anonymous path re-probed → still 403. Owner decisions open: D2, D3, D7, D8, D9
- INV-2026-10-03-001 → `REMEDIATION_ADVICE.md` written (rotate → restrict → re-seed scrubbed → policy). Registrar to set `blocked_on: [INFRA, CRM]`
- Gate position: both Tier-1 items at **Gate 2 (owner acceptance of Impact Analysis)**. Implementation Plan not yet written. Nothing coded until "Role 3 approved for <ID>"
- `registry_sync.py sync` NOT run this session (OAuth token may be expired; owner to confirm)
- 2026-10-07 Gate 2 rulings recorded — BUG-001: D1=a, D4=b, D5=b, D6=yes · CR-003: D2=a, D3=a, D7=b/i, D8=yes, D9=here. Owner holding at Gate 2; Implementation Plans NOT written; registry sync deferred
- 2026-10-07 Gate 2 ACCEPTED for BUG-2026-10-06-001 → IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md written (E1–E6, T1–T16). Gate 3 not open. CR-003 still at Gate 2
- 2026-10-07 Gate 3 accepted → Role 3 applied E1–E6 (5 files + new smoke test, markers BUG-2026-10-06-001) → self-test 11/16 PASS (rest deferred) → Role 4 QA via testing agent **PASS 11/11** (`test_reports/iteration_1.json`). index.yml `SMOKE`; owner smoke pending. Handover: `SESSION_HANDOVER_2026-10-07.md`
- 2026-10-07 Owner convention: **SMOKE_BRIEF.md + .pdf mandatory after every BUG/CR QA PASS** (control prompt §9 + Role 8 updated). Tool: `memory/tools/smoke_brief.py` (markdown → PDF via headless Chrome; `pip install markdown`). First instance: BUG-2026-10-06-001/SMOKE_BRIEF.pdf (2 pages)
- 2026-10-07 Gate 2 ACCEPTED for CR-2026-10-03-003 → IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (E1–E4, T1–T12). P1 flagged: diner sign-in is on landing page (/login is admin-only). Gate 3 not open
- 2026-10-07 CR-003 gap G1–G5 found (phone on landing ≠ login except skipOtp/password-complete path) → owner ruled D10=a. Follow-up CR-2026-10-07-001 registered (blocked on CRM CR-096). CRM Wave-1 change log received → `memory/inbox/` + SUMMARY (OTP routes deleted; our calls already quarantined; 3 owner questions open). CR-003 awaiting Gate 3 phrase
- 2026-10-07 Owner: (1) new CR for permanent OTP deletion → CR-2026-10-07-002 registered (INTAKE, 31 markers/8 files, skipOtp* out of scope); (2) identity-path intent → validation questions drafted for CRM `inbox/OUTBOUND_DRAFT_CRM_QUESTIONS_2026-10-07.md` (owner sends); (3) CR-084 confirmation only AFTER deletion ships. Registry 89 items. Gates unchanged: BUG-001 SMOKE · CR-003 awaiting Gate 3
- 2026-10-07 Gate 3 accepted CR-2026-10-03-003 → Role 3 (E1–E4 + contract test update + setRestaurantScope restore) → self-test → Role 4 QA **PASS 11/11** (`test_reports/iteration_2.json`) → SMOKE_BRIEF.pdf → index `SMOKE`. Deviation: order_id never attaches until CR-2026-09-15-001 fixes crmGetOrders v1 path. CRM_NOTE_FEEDBACK_PURGE.md drafted (owner sends)
- 2026-10-08 CRM reply received (identity rulings a–d; CR-093/098 w/c 13 Oct, CR-096 w/c 27 Oct) → filed `inbox/CRM_REPLY_IDENTITY_RULINGS_2026-10-08.md` + `inbox/IMPACT_OF_CRM_REPLY_2026-10-08.md`. HARD DEADLINE: password page breaks w/c 13 Oct (register/login → 404). No code, no gate moved; owner decisions A–D open
- 2026-10-08 Role 1: registered CR-2026-10-08-001 (single identity path, P1, deadline w/c 13 Oct); re-scoped CR-2026-09-15-002 (409 drop / 429 keep); CR-2026-10-03-004 annotated with frozen lookup contract + blocked_on CRM CR-093; CR-2026-10-07-001 date 27 Oct; -002 and 09-15-003 notes. Registry 90. Execution order proposed in chat
- 2026-10-08 Session handover written: `memory/SESSION_HANDOVER_2026-10-08_TIER1_SHIPPED_IDENTITY_PIVOT.md` (authoritative; supersedes 2026-10-07 snapshot). Next agent: summarise → present order → ask §6 Q1–Q11 → wait for owner phrase. No role active.
- 2026-10-08 Smoke-brief audit (memory only, no app code): gap found — CR-2026-10-07-002 had QA PASS (iteration_6) but no SMOKE_BRIEF → written + PDF rendered. New tool `memory/tools/smoke_briefs_all.py` (needs `pip install pypdf`) merges all 6 per-item PDFs into `memory/SMOKE_BRIEFS_ALL_<date>.pdf` with cover index + bookmarks (14 pages). Per-item PDFs remain source of truth. Owner smoke still pending on all 6: BUG-2026-10-06-001, CR-2026-10-03-003, CR-2026-10-08-001, CR-2026-09-15-001, CR-2026-10-03-004, CR-2026-10-07-002
- 2026-10-09 CRM reply (validations accepted · CR-102 shipped · 4 bounce-backs) filed `inbox/CRM_REPLY_VALIDATIONS_ACCEPTED_CR102_2026-10-09.md`. CR-102 checked vs code: already compliant, no change. CA-4/CA-5 answers ready from memory (B1/B2 already reconciled 3 Oct; CRM's B2 guess wrong). **Correction:** `customer_app_config`/`dietary_tags_mapping` are Customer-App-owned — earlier "migrate reads to CRM API" idea was wrong; CRM's CR-095 deletes *their* 4 orphan routes. Role 1: registered **CR-2026-10-09-001** (our side of CR-095: zero-caller confirmation, gate ruling D1, post-removal verification, §4d countersign; P2/LOW). Registry 91. Next: owner "Planning for CR-2026-10-09-001" + D1; then outbound CRM reply draft (CA-2/4/5/8)
- 2026-10-09 Owner ruled **D1 = (i)** (release CRM from the 4-step gate; CR-095 ships independent of our steps 2–3). Role 2: IMPACT_ANALYSIS + IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN written for CR-2026-10-09-001 (Phase 1 confirmation note → Phase 2 post-removal verification E3–E5 → Phase 3 §4d countersign on OWNERSHIP_MAP, map stays DRAFT). No app code. index.yml INTAKE → PLANNING. Gate 3 not open. D3 (§4d signing authority) still needed before Phase 3
- 2026-10-09 Gate 3 accepted CR-2026-10-09-001 → Role 3 Phase 1: pre-flight 0 callers, baseline 13/0 docs, `CONFIRMATION_NOTE_TO_CRM.md` drafted (CA-2 + CA-8 "CR-095 released, ship at will" · CA-4 B1 names + otp_tokens row delete · CA-5 B2 names, CRM guess corrected · CR-102 ack). index.yml → IMPLEMENTATION. Owner sends. Phase 2 trigger phrase: "CRM shipped CR-095". D3 RULED: owner signs §4d personally (E1 prepares text only)
- 2026-10-09 Role 2 Planning for **CR-2026-10-03-001** (delete dead CRM-table call sites in server.py): IA + IP written. Live re-verify: 13 touches / 9 routes+branches (C1 get_current_user customer branch · C3 login Step 1 · set-password · verify-password · 6× /api/customer/*), 0 FE callers; `customer_router` + 6 models orphaned (incl. pre-existing `ResetPasswordRequest`). OUT: customer-lookup, loyalty-settings, db.users. Must land before CR-2026-09-15-004. index.yml INTAKE → PLANNING (P3/HIGH-by-file). Gate 3 not open; D1 delete (rec) · D2 trim LoginRequest/Response (rec) · D3 AuthContext.login → 09-15-004 (rec)
- 2026-10-09 Owner RULED CR-2026-10-03-001: D1 (a) delete · D2 (a) trim · D3 (a) backend-only (AuthContext.login() deletion added to CR-2026-09-15-004 notes). IA/IP/index.yml updated. **Gate 3 explicitly NOT opened by owner** — do not implement until phrase given
- 2026-10-09 CR-2026-10-03-001 IP Appendix A added: line-level edit map (15 ranges, bottom-up, pinned to server.py md5 2aea049a/1741 lines, expected ≈1369 after). Still PLANNING, Gate 3 closed
- 2026-10-09 **CR-2026-10-03-001 IMPLEMENTED** (Gate 3 accepted): server.py 1741→1367 (−378/+5) — customer login branch, set/verify-password, 6× /api/customer/*, customer_router, 6 orphan models deleted; dead-touch grep 14→1. Self-test 12/12·31/31·14/14; testing agent iteration_8 28/28 + 61/61 PASS. QA_HANDOVER + SMOKE_BRIEF(.pdf); consolidated handout regenerated (7 items). Status SMOKE → awaiting "Smoke PASS CR-2026-10-03-001". Side-effect: admin login no longer checks customers first (latent wrong-token bug fixed)
- 2026-10-09 Session handover written: `memory/SESSION_HANDOVER_2026-10-09_NARRATIVE.md` (**authoritative**; owner asked for story-form — next agent must tell the session in one flow, then what's left, then priority, then STOP). Table-form twin: `SESSION_HANDOVER_2026-10-09_CR095_REGISTERED_CR001_SHIPPED.md`. Discovery at session end: CRM CR-094 live (`/scan/loyalty-rules/478` → 200) → CR-2026-10-03-004 Parts B+C unblocked. No role active. 7 items at owner smoke.
