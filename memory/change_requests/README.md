# CR Registry — Customer-app 3-july branch (Session 2026-07-03)

Index of all Change Requests raised, planned, or shipped during the
INVESTIGATION → PLANNING → IMPLEMENTATION cycles on 2026-07-03.

> **Note on process compliance:** the operating prompt
> `control/MYGENIE_CUSTOMER_APP_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_ALPHA_v0_1.md` §8 Role 1
> mandates an **INTAKE** step (with an `INTAKE_DOC.md` artefact and
> `Intake complete: <ID>` output block) before any Planning or Implementation.
> The 10 items below were originally created without that step —
> **retroactive `INTAKE_DOC.md` artefacts were added** to each folder to
> restore compliance. Future items should be raised via Role 1 first.

## Legend
- ✅ SHIPPED — code merged, self-tested, QA handover written
- 🚧 IMPLEMENTED, QA-pending — code merged, waiting on human QA
- 📋 PLANNED — CR + IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN written, awaiting owner approval
- 📝 REGISTERED — CR written, no plan yet OR data/ops-owned
- 🔬 AUDIT (INV) — read-only investigation task, no code planned
- ⚰️ TOMBSTONE — ID was issued but renamed to another ID; row kept for traceability

## ID Scheme (canonicalized 2026-07-03 by CR-2026-07-03-010)

This branch uses two ID formats. Both are valid; use is scoped by era, not by type:

| Format | Status | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `BUG-NNN` (global 3-digit sequence, 001..050) | **FROZEN** at BUG-050 as of 2026-07-03 | Historical cross-references only. Do not issue new IDs in this format. |
| `CR-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` (per-day 3-digit sequence) | **ACTIVE** — canonical for all new work | New change requests, feature work, refactors, doc updates, data ops. |
| `INV-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` (per-day 3-digit sequence) | **ACTIVE** | Investigations only (read-only, no code, per Alpha v0.1 §8 Role 6). |

**Canonical bug tracker for the legacy `BUG-NNN` sequence: NONE — the source is gone.**
`/app/memory_repo/` **does not exist in this pod.** Neither `BUG_TRACKER.md` nor
`BUG_TRACKER_ARCHITECTURAL_AUDIT_2026-05.md` (formerly `BUG_TRACKER_v2.md`) can be located.
Owner ruling **D-R5 (session after 2026-10-03): `/app/memory` is canonical; `memory_repo` is
deprecated — do not cite it.** 19 legacy IDs survive only as cross-references in 33 documents;
their open/closed status is being reconstructed in
[INV-2026-10-04-001](./INV-2026-10-04-001-legacy-bug-id-status-reconstruction/INTAKE_DOC.md).
The previously documented count of "10 open bugs (2x P0, 8x P1)" is **unverifiable** and must not
be relied on. Recorded as finding F5/F7 of
[CR-2026-10-04-004](./CR-2026-10-04-004-registry-reconciliation/INTAKE_DOC.md).

**`BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` is also ACTIVE** for new bugs (3 such folders exist and are now registered
below). The table at line 28 omitted it.

**Tombstones.** If an ID is issued and later renamed (e.g. CR-2026-07-03-006 was renamed
mid-session to INV-2026-07-03-001), a **tombstone row** must be added to the table below
with status `⚰️ TOMBSTONE`, pointing at the successor ID. Do not delete or reuse tombstone IDs.

## Shared-DB boundary remediation (registered 2026-10-03 — Role 1 INTAKE)

Gap-closure pass over INV-2026-09-15-003 (direct CRM-table access audit) + CRM reply INV-022 +

## Code-Correctness Sprint (opened in the session after 2026-10-03)

Owner-approved batch: **Gate 0 + Track A + Track B + Track C** — fix the code before adding
functionality. Full plan, sequencing and the 7 owner decisions (D-S1…D-S7):
**`/app/memory/SPRINT_CODE_CORRECTNESS.md`**.

### Gate 0 result (session after 2026-10-03) — **QA PASSED, awaiting owner smoke**

Two CRs that had been merged in earlier sessions and marked *"awaiting QA (Role 4)"* for weeks were
finally QA'd, and **both pass**: **CR-2026-09-12-004** (rate limit fires under burst; all 5 security
headers present) and **CR-2026-09-14-001** (`/api/auth/send-otp` → 404, no OTP UI, no
`otpRequired*` toggles, customer flow unaffected). Both now have regression tests
(`backend/tests/smoke/test_cr_2026_09_12_004.py`) so they cannot silently rot again.
**CR-2026-10-03-002 QA PASSED** — and QA found one unrelated P1 (**CR-2026-10-04-003**), whose fix the owner then **reverted** into CR-2026-09-12-008's scope; that bug remains live.
Suite: **25 passed · 12 snapshots · 0 errors**. QA report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_2.json`.


**Correction to the record (5th on this track):** CR-2026-09-12-005 is registered as
*"✅ CLOSED — 22/22 PASS, safety net live."* On a fresh pod the suite **could not complete a green
run** (missing plugins, then 429 from a sibling CR's rate limiter). Fixed as CR-2026-10-04-002.
Measured coverage is **~16 of 44 routes** — the uncovered set is the money-and-identity surface
(`/orders`, `/points`, `/wallet`, `/profile`, `/set-password`, `/verify-password`, `/feedback`…).
Owner decision **D-S2**: extend snapshots to all 44 routes **before** the monolith split.

**Measured state of the code, re-verified this session (not from docs):** `server.py` **1,878**
lines (not 1,829) · **21** direct CRM-table touches (not 20) · **65** occurrences of `716` ·
`ReviewOrder.jsx` **2,070** lines. Zero architecture work has been built.


### Contract freeze (2026-10-03)

CRM replied twice to INV-022. Round 2 settled A9-b and Q-CA-6, so the exchange has been collapsed
into one signable document: **`/app/memory/control/CONTRACT_CUSTOMER_APP_CRM_v1.0.md` (v1.0-RC1)**.
Part 1 (ground rules · collection ownership · identity · endpoint-by-endpoint API contract ·
accepted limitations · execution sequence) is **ready to sign**. Part 2 (§7) lists the 9 items
that still block a full freeze — the biggest being **O-1**, CRM's ownership-board JSON, which was
referenced in round 2 but never reached us and which gates `OWNERSHIP_MAP.md` (and therefore
CR-2026-09-12-006, CR-010 and CR-014).

**Update — CRM's ownership-board JSON received 2026-10-03 (contract item O-1 closed).** 39
collections, code-scanned with read/write counts and file:line. Reconciled in
`INV-002/RECONCILIATION_CRM_BOARD_2026-10-03.md`: **36 of 39 rows agree**, including all 8 rows we
had previously assigned by elimination. Contract bumped to **v1.0-RC2** with §2 completed; O-1, O-2
and O-3 closed; four new items opened — **D-1** `pos_event_logs` owner semantics (CRM assigns
ownership to the consumer, our rule assigns it to the sole writer), **D-2** `orders`/`order_items`
"Shared (POS-origin)" label, **D-3** `otp_tokens` contradicts CRM's own round-1 E3, and **O-10** a
`users` change-notice gap created by CRM withdrawing B4 while we still read that collection on
every admin request. **`OWNERSHIP_MAP.md` deliberately still unedited** — the CRM half is in, but
POS P1/P4/P5 and three owner rulings remain.

**Owner rulings 2026-10-03 → contract v1.0-RC3.** **D-1** `pos_event_logs` owner = **CRM** (the sole
writer), consumer = POS required, inert until POS consumes — CRM's proposal to assign ownership to
the consumer was declined so that "owner = writer" stays consistent across all 39 rows. **D-2**
`orders`/`order_items` owner = **CRM**, annotated "originates in POS via webhook"; the "Shared"
label rejected. **O-4** (Call Waiter / Pay Bill direction) and the **Pay-Bill definition** referred
to **POS** → `INV-002/QUESTIONS_FOR_POS_2026-09-15.md` extended with **P1-refined, P5, P6, P7**
(P2/P3 closed by CRM, P4 parked). Pay-Bill semantics reserved as contract clause **§3 I6**: a
request to settle at the table, **never** an in-app payment. **All 39 ownership rows now have an
owner; Part 1 of the contract is ready for signature.** Remaining blocker is **POS**, plus F3.

**CRM SIGNED Part 1 on 2026-10-03** (`INV-003/crm_replies/CONTRACT_v1.0_CRM_SIGNOFF.md`; validated
clean in `INV-003/VALIDATION_OF_CRM_SIGNOFF_2026-10-03.md` — no conflicts, no conditional clauses).
CRM **concurs** with the D-1/D-2 rulings, so those rows are now mutually agreed rather than
unilaterally ruled. **D-3, O-8 and O-10 closed**: `otp_tokens` confirmed as a separate staff
password-reset store (E3 was scoped to customer OTP); feedback CR = **CR-096**, `restaurant_id` =
short form; and **CRM agreed to give advance notice before renaming any of the six `users` fields**
until our POS switch lands — the item most likely to have caused a silent admin-login outage.
**CONTRACT PART 1 §1-§6 IS NOW FROZEN — countersigned by the owner 2026-10-03.** It may only change under §8 change control (written agreement from both teams + version bump). §7 stays open and is owed by **POS** (P1-refined, P5, P6, P7) and the **owner** (F3, O-7); nothing in §7 reopens Part 1, and POS is not a Part-1 signatory.
Two findings from validating the sign-off: CRM's per-tier `*_earn_percent` warning is **already
satisfied** in our code (`LoyaltyRewardsSection.jsx:29`), so CR-094 is a URL swap; and CR-093's
`exists` **must** be mapped to our `found` flag or the first-visit-bonus line will show for every
diner — both recorded in CR-2026-10-03-004 §1a.

**Owner decisions on the POS reply (2026-10-03):** amendment **A-1 drafted** for CRM
(`control/AMENDMENT_A-1_pos_event_logs_consumer.md`, awaiting owner sign-off) · POS **not** being
chased for the two missing shapes — they said they would come back · **franchise support split out
as CR-2026-10-03-006**, so CR-2026-09-15-004 stays single-outlet on `restaurants[0]` (no
regression — identical to today's behaviour and CRM's) with a new acceptance criterion that the
backend **warns when it ignores extra outlets** · Call Waiter "not live" clarified as **not built
yet, not cancelled** → CR-2026-10-03-005 is **parked, not withdrawn**; buttons, flags and CRM
endpoints all stay in place · **still in INTAKE** — no code, no Planning artefacts.

**POS replied 2026-10-03** (`INV-002/VALIDATION_OF_POS_REPLY_2026-10-03.md`). **P1 = (b): POS does
not read `pos_event_logs`** — so with CRM write-only and us never touching it, **no component
anywhere reads that collection**; Call Waiter / Pay Bill cannot work in the current architecture,
not merely "not yet wired". POS then **parked** the direction (P2) and the Pay-Bill semantics (P3)
— "feature is not live" — so **CR-2026-10-03-005 is PARKED** with evidence. **P4.2: `restaurants[]`
CAN hold multiple entries, for franchises** → **CR-2026-09-15-004 scope widened**: it now needs an
outlet picker and a selected-outlet concept threaded through every per-restaurant admin operation,
not just an identity swap. Two shapes still owed by POS (**O-14** profile path + shape — their "ok"
acknowledged rather than answered P4.1; **O-13** multi-entry shape), plus **P4.3** (rate limit /
token lifetime / refresh), whose rationale is written up for them.

🔴 **First change-control event: contract amendment A-1.** Frozen §2d annotates `pos_event_logs` as
*"consumer = POS — required"*, which POS's answer makes factually wrong. **It has not been edited** —
§2 is frozen, so under **§8 C1** this needs written agreement from CRM plus a version bump to
**v1.1**. Proposed text: *consumer = NONE as at 2026-10-03; a consumer must be designated before
any producer is wired.* Ownership unchanged (CRM remains sole writer).

**Measured, not assumed:** the owner's "buttons are already hidden by configuration" was verified
against the live shared DB — true for **12 of 13** tenants, but restaurant **`672`** has
`showLandingPayBill: true` and is showing a dead Pay Bill button today. Also found: the two
`showLanding*` flags have **no admin toggle** (`VisibilityTab.jsx` / `AdminVisibilityPage.jsx`
expose only `showCallWaiter`/`showPayBill`), so 672's flag cannot be cleared from the admin UI.
Both recorded in CR-2026-10-03-005 §1b.

Supporting artefacts: `INV-003/VALIDATION_OF_CRM_REPLY_ROUND2.md` (row-by-row verdict, 2 corrections
to our own record) · `INV-003/REPLY_TO_CRM_ROUND2_AND_FREEZE.md` (draft reply + freeze request,
awaiting owner sign-off) · `INV-003/crm_replies/INV_022_CRM_REPLY_TO_CUSTOMER_APP_ROUND2.md`.

### Security escalation — INV-2026-10-03-001 (2026-10-03)

Contract item **O-16** has been **escalated out of the contract** into its own security
investigation on owner instruction: [INV-2026-10-03-001](./INV-2026-10-03-001-uat-secrets-and-pii-exposure/INTAKE_DOC.md).
Two findings: (1) preprod issues a **static `dp_live_`-prefixed CRM credential** — obtainable by
anyone with a preprod POS account, and almost certainly the `api_key` on CRM's `users` row;
(2) the **shared UAT database holds real customer PII**, including **114 `customer_documents`**
(hotel guest identity documents), admin emails and `password_hash`.

**P1 SECURITY · owning team DevOps/Ops** (+ CRM, POS). **No Customer App code change expected** —
the defect is in environment and data-handling practice, so filing it as a code CR would bury it in
a queue nobody who can fix it reads. Brief ready to send:
`INV-2026-10-03-001/BRIEF_FOR_DEVOPS_UAT_DATA_HYGIENE.md`. The secret value is **not recorded in
any document**; raw HTTP responses were deleted; no production access was attempted and no DB
writes were made. Its **Q9** (preprod/production shared secrets) pairs with contract **O-7**.

Direct consequence for the registry: **this finding is the evidence that CR-2026-10-03-002 is a
real P0** — the `api_key` it projects away is demonstrably a live-prefixed credential, not a
theoretical secret.

Registered under **[CR-2026-10-04-004](./CR-2026-10-04-004-registry-reconciliation/INTAKE_DOC.md)**
(Role 1 Intake, session after 2026-10-03, owner-approved).

Statuses below are taken **verbatim from each folder's own documents**, not inferred. Where a
folder carries no status line, the row says so rather than guessing. Per **R1 (code is truth)**,
where a folder's `CR.md` and its `QA_HANDOVER.md` disagree, the QA artefact wins and the conflict
is flagged.

Owner decision **D-R2:** the three `2026-02-XX` IDs are registered **as-is**. The day of month was
never recorded ("Registered: 2026-02 (this session)"), git cannot recover it (repo cloned fresh),
and the three IDs carry **22 code markers across 4 CRITICAL hotspot files**
(`ReviewOrder.jsx` 11, `CartContext.js` 4, `DeliveryAddress.jsx` 4, `LandingPage.jsx` 3).
Renaming would invent a date and churn open work. Canonicalisation may be filed separately.

### Audit findings recorded (§10.6)

| # | Finding |
|---|---|
| F1 | **15 IDs carried live code markers with no registry row** — now all registered |
| F2 | **Ghost ID `INV-2026-08-06-001`** — appears in a code marker, has no folder and no row anywhere. Origin unknown |
| F3 | **Status drift** inside `CR-2026-02-XX-001` (its `CR.md` says "Planning", its QA handover says shipped and verified) |
| F4 | **`CR-2026-02-XX-002` shipped beyond its approved scope** → CR-2026-10-04-005 |
| F5 | The registry's own ID-Scheme section pointed into the absent `/app/memory_repo` — **corrected above** |
| F6 | **`CR-2026-07-03-010` is marked ✅ SHIPPED** but left 3 `XX`-day IDs, a colon-bearing folder and 23 unregistered items behind. Recorded, not re-opened |
| F7 | **19 legacy `BUG-NNN` IDs with no status source** → INV-2026-10-04-001 |

**Not done, deliberately:** the operating prompt's addendum Part B §10 carries the same stale
`memory_repo` references. A corrected replacement was drafted and the owner has **held it for
review** (D-R7). Editing the prompt requires owner approval per §7, so it is unchanged.

**Registry rows: 52 → 79.** `grep` for code markers referencing unregistered IDs now returns **0**
(excluding the F2 ghost, which has no artefacts to register).

## What this registry is NOT

- Not an issue tracker. This is a session-scoped planning artefact.
- Not a substitute for a real ticketing system. Owner should port these to whatever tracker they use.
- Not evidence of implementation for anything marked ✅ — SHIPPED. Refer to each folder's `QA_HANDOVER.md` for that.

## Session shipping summary

- **Session dates:** 2026-07-03 (initial) + 2026-07-04 (continuation)
- **Items raised:** 16 (14 CR + 1 INV + 1 tombstone; CR-006 tombstoned in favour of INV-2026-07-03-001)
- **Shipped (code merged + self-tested):** 3 (001, 002, 003)
- **Shipped (docs-only, self-tested):** 1 (010 — registry hygiene)
- **Resolved by owner assertion:** 1 (INV-001 — order-create idempotency, D-02)
- **Implemented, awaiting owner smoke:** 2 (000, 004)
- **Planned (Role 2 complete, awaiting owner approval / prereqs):** 1 (005)
- **Registered (Role 1 complete):** 8 (007, 008, 009, 011, 012, plus new 2026-07-04 items 002/003/004)
- **Process compliance:** Role 1 (INTAKE) was skipped initially; retroactively remediated on 2026-07-03. Full ID-scheme canonicalization performed by CR-2026-07-03-010. CR-000 upgraded from stub to full Role 6+2+3 flow; CR-011 (full POS proxy) and CR-012 (doc scrub + CI lint) filed as its architectural + hygiene follow-ups. CR-004 shipped in plumbing scope; residual UI + admin work filed as CR-2026-07-04-003. Owner-asked telemetry gap filed as CR-2026-07-04-004. Registry canonicalization finish-up (A/B/C from CR-010 §8) filed as CR-2026-07-04-002.

## Previously unregistered items — backfilled 2026-10-06

Two folders existed on disk with **no ID at all**, so they could not be indexed and were invisible to
every count, the Summary tab and the Tech Dashboard. Both contain completed work.

**Root cause:** `CR-2026-07-03-010` (registry hygiene / ID-scheme canonicalisation) explicitly listed
both by name under *"files NOT touched"*, treating them as closed folders whose internal artefacts
were out of scope. The CR that should have caught them scoped them out. Surfaced by
`CR-2026-10-04-006`'s audit (*"folders without a well-formed ID"*) and ID'd on owner instruction.

| ID | Title | Status | Priority | Files | Owner action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [CR-2026-XX-XX-001](./CR-2026-XX-XX-001-round-up-payload-gap/ROUND_UP_PAYLOAD_GAP_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md) | **`round_up` payload gap** | 📝 **UNADJUDICATED** — backfilled, status pending owner ruling. Carries investigation report, implementation plan, implementation report **and** QA report, i.e. a completed plan→implement→QA lifecycle | TBD | TBD | adjudicate status; confirm `Type` = CR (code shipped) rather than INV; **supply a registration date — no date appears anywhere in its documents** |
| [INV-2026-05-01-001](./INV-2026-05-01-001-metadata-branch-diff/METADATA_BRANCH_DIFF_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md) | **Metadata branch diff: `main` vs `14-may`** | 📝 **UNADJUDICATED** — backfilled, status pending owner ruling. Investigation report, Phase 1 cherry-pick plan, Phase 1 file-restore execution report | TBD | TBD | adjudicate status; date `2026-05-01` derived from the earliest date in its own documents |

**Judgement calls made, cheap to reverse:**
- `CR-2026-XX-XX-001` uses the `XX-XX` placeholder because **no date exists in any of its four
  documents** — month and day are both unknown. The year is assumed 2026 in line with every other
  item. `Registered` stays blank; per contract §3 the owner fills it.
- Its `Type` was set to **CR** rather than INV because it shipped code through a full implement→QA
  cycle. The folder name says "investigation" and its first artefact is an investigation report, so
  INV is arguable.
- `INV-2026-05-01-001` is dated from the **earliest** date found in its documents (`2026-05-01`; the
  other is `2026-05-13`).

**Effect:** registry goes **78 → 80 items**, with nothing on disk invisible. Both are **Unrouted**
until adjudicated — a valid transitional state under contract v1.1 §4 (back-catalogue interim).
`round_up` is also a **money-path candidate** (scored 56 on money-path keyword density in
`CR-2026-10-04-006`'s impact analysis §16.1) that could not previously be tagged because it could not
be indexed.

## Intake pass — 2026-10-06 (ROLE 1) · registry 80 → 87

Full record, method and the four deliberate non-registrations:
[`INTAKE_PASS_2026-10-06.md`](./INTAKE_PASS_2026-10-06.md).

The previous audit showed 80 indexed / 80 folders with zero orphans, so nothing **on disk** was
unregistered. What it could not see was IDs living in **documents and shipped code** with no row
behind them. A sweep of every `TYPE-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` token across `memory/`, `backend/`,
`frontend/src` and `tests/` found **89 distinct IDs, 80 registered, 9 unregistered** — of which 7
were real items.

Severities and risks below were proposed by the agent and **ratified by the owner in chat**.

| ID | Title | Status | Severity / Risk | Owner action needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [CR-2026-10-06-001](./CR-2026-10-06-001-walkin-and-tableless-order-enforcement/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Enforce the non-QR order block** — walk-in QR is an exempt scan type and the table-status check is skipped when `table_id` is `'0'`. Fix CR for `INV-2026-06-17-001`, whose report was written **2026-06-17** and never got one. All 3 bypass paths re-verified live this session | 📝 REGISTERED (Role 1 done) | **P1 / HIGH** (`orderAccessPolicy.js`, `ReviewOrder.jsx`, order-placement path) | **rule on option A/B/C/D.** Only **B** (server-side enforcement) closes the dev-tools bypass, and B overlaps `CR-2026-07-03-011` — plan together if chosen |
| [CR-2026-10-06-002](./CR-2026-10-06-002-multi-menu-table-status-check-skip/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Multi-menu restaurants skip the table/room status check at landing**, and the manually-picked room is never validated. Skip is keyed to the literal `'716'`. Fix CR for `INV-2026-06-17-003`, also **2026-06-17**, also never given one | 📝 REGISTERED (Role 1 done) | **P1 / HIGH** — upgraded from the parent's P2, rationale in intake §7, **needs ratification** | **answer Q1–Q3.** Q3 collides with `CR-2026-08-03-001`, which is **HELD** on a POS data backfill |
| [INV-2026-08-06-001](./INV-2026-08-06-001-admin-qr-pos-token-session/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Ghost ID closed out** — admin QR page, POS token expiry handling (fix 2a) + direct order-type QR codes (fix 2b). Both live in `AdminQRPage.jsx`, never owner-verified. Folder and intake **reconstructed from the code markers**; this was finding **F2** of `CR-2026-10-04-004`, origin recorded as *unknown* | 📝 REGISTERED (reconstructed) — fixes already live | P2 / LOW | none required. Optional QA of fix 2a/2b rides on `CR-2026-10-04-001`, which owns the same file |
| [INV-2026-08-03-001](./INV-2026-08-03-001-716-hardcoding-audit/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Hyatt (716) hardcoding audit** — 27 code-level hardcodings across 8 files plus 3 other hardcoding classes. Complete since August with a full Role 6 sign-off (10/10 steps, HIGH confidence), cited by three documents, and carried **no registry row** | 🔬 REPORT WRITTEN / resolved — subsumed by `CR-2026-08-03-001` | P2 / LOW | none. Remediation stays with `CR-2026-08-03-001` (HELD) |
| [CR-2026-09-12-016](./CR-2026-09-12-016-dead-fe-env-key-deletion/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Delete dead references to `REACT_APP_CRM_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_RESTAURANT_ID`.** ID was reserved on 2026-09-12 by decision D-007-2, which ended *"Owner drives Role 1 to file it"* — never filed until now | 📝 REGISTERED (Role 1 done) — Wave 3 | P3 / LOW | none to unblock. **V3 runs first:** if either key is present in `frontend/.env`, the CR's premise is void |
| [CR-2026-06-XX-001](./CR-2026-06-XX-001-architecture-tier-a/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **DUPLICATE** — "architecture tier A" (OTP echo · CORS · `.env.example` · CI). Was a *proposed* ID inside a June handover recommendation, never filed. All four parts shipped under `CR-2026-09-12-003`, `CR-2026-09-12-004`, `CR-2026-07-03-007`, `CR-2026-09-12-005` and `CR-2026-09-12-015` | **DUPLICATE** — registered for traceability only | — | none. Closed on arrival |
| [BUG-2026-10-06-001](./BUG-2026-10-06-001-non-qr-bypass-not-observable/INTAKE_DOC.md) | **Non-QR policy telemetry records blocks but never bypasses.** `postNonQrBlock` sits *inside* `if (policy.block)` at all three checkpoints, so every allow — including every walk-in bypass — is unrecorded; the decision is `console.log`'d to the **customer's own browser** instead. Endpoint, collection and index already exist and need no change. **This is why `CR-2026-10-06-001` cannot be sized** | 📝 REGISTERED (Role 1 done) | **P1 / LOW to fix** | **none to start** — needs no A/B/C/D ruling. The cheapest P1 on the board |

### `CR-2026-10-04-006` — ✅ GATE 2 PASSED, 2026-10-06

Contract **v1.2** merged; **all three SO-raised defects closed** (A and C in v1.1; **B as D-A8**,
resolved at **3** accepted columns — `Status`, `Registered`, `Closed` — against SO's 1-column
recommendation). The amendment carries **21 changes · 36 verifications · 13 phases**, risk **MEDIUM**
(owner ruling R2).

[`IMPACT_ANALYSIS_AMENDMENT.md`](./CR-2026-10-04-006-google-sheet-registry-mirror/IMPACT_ANALYSIS_AMENDMENT.md)
(rev 3) and
[`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AMENDMENT.md`](./CR-2026-10-04-006-google-sheet-registry-mirror/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AMENDMENT.md)
are written, and the owner **accepted the plan line-by-line**, accepting the open items as known
risks (**D-A2** OAuth publishing status, 7th ask; column M protected by omission, not permission).

**GATE 3 is SHUT.** Execution needs `Role 3 approved for CR-2026-10-04-006`, verbatim. Two things the
implementing agent must not get wrong: the **first push after P6 is irreversible** (the live sheet has
no version history we control and four other projects read it — the only rollback is P0's 9-tab
snapshot), and **`changelog()` at `registry_sync.py:536` is not the contract's `Change Log` tab** —
merging them destroys the approval trail (V48).

**Also updated, no new IDs:** `BUG-042` added to `INV-2026-10-04-001` (**the legacy set is 20, not
19** — its ID list was built from documents and never cross-checked against source) · a stale
self-citation inside `INV-2026-09-15-003` corrected to the owning item · the stock-out investigation
referenced by `CR-2026-09-07-001` recorded as that CR's paperwork rather than its own item ·
`CR-2026-10-04-006` addendum for **contract v1.1.1 accepted, 21 changes, risk LOW → MEDIUM**. The two
non-registered IDs are named in [`INTAKE_PASS_2026-10-06.md`](./INTAKE_PASS_2026-10-06.md) §4 and
deliberately kept out of this file, because every ID named here is counted by the audit.

**Note on blank `Status` cells.** All six new rows carry `status: null` in `index.yml`, with their
adjudicated contract value held in `status_note` (`INTAKE` ×3, `IMPLEMENTED`, `CLOSED`, `DUPLICATE`).
`registry_sync.py` still validates the **legacy 13-value** enum, so writing a v1.1 status today would
make every `audit` and `sync` exit 1 against its own registry. The 8-value enum ships with amendment
change **#10**, and all statuses are written in one pass after it.

**Audit after the pass:** 87 indexed · 87 folders · 0 orphans · 0 duplicates · 0 index rows missing
from this README · **1** README-only row remaining — `CR-2026-07-03-006`, the intentional tombstone.
The `INV-2026-08-06-001` ghost is gone.
